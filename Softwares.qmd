***KinomeRun-integrative pipeline for virtual target screening and interaction pattern analysis***\
<center><img src="images/kinomerun.jpg" width=600 height=500 > </img></center>\

<p align="justify"> KinomeRun is a python based GUI pipeline which can be used for performing the target screening with the ligand of interest. It can be used to perform inverse screening against the kinome structures. KinomeRun integrates AutoDock Vina for performing the virtual screening and Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler for calculation of the kinome-ligand interaction patterns at Largescale. The customized filteration analysis using KinomeRun will enable the user to specify the interaction filteraction pattern of their own for target prioritization and ranking for visualization in the Kinometree produced by KinomeRender. </p>

***Peptide Virtual Screening Pipeline***\

<center><img src="images/pepvis.jpg" width=400 height=400 > </img> </center>\

<p align="justify">PepVis tool is a python based GUI pipeline which can be used to model and prepare large-scale peptide structure from the sequence and also to perform large-scale peptide virtual screening. PepVis integrates ModPep and Gromacs for modelling and structure optimization of the peptides, while it integrates AutoDock Vina, ZDOCK, AutoDock CrankPep(ADCP) for performing peptide virtual screening. The protein-peptide complexes can be rescored using ZRANK2 and the flexible refinement of the large protein-peptide complexes can also be performed using FlexPepDock. The parallel job execution have been implemented using GNU parallel and the user can provide inputs using GUI which will produce the bash script based on the customized input provided by the user and can be run in terminal.</p>

***POAP(Parallelized Open Babel & Autodock suite Pipeline): A GNU Parallel based multithreaded pipeline of Open Babel and Autodock suite for boosted HighThroughput Virtual Screening***\
<center><img src="images/POAP.jpg" width=400 height=400 align="center"> </img></center>\

<p align="justify">POAP tool is a bash shell script based pipeline which can be used to optimize ligands for docking using openbabel and also to perform virtual screening using Autodock Suite. It allows users to interactively choose options for performing ligand optimization for large sets of ligands. POAP uses GNU parallel to perform the fast and efficient way for the completion of jobs by optimally utilising multiple CPU threads, thereby reducing the time effectively. It also quarantines the ligands causing error during preparation, enabling seamless operability. POAP implements dynamic filehandling methods for efficient memory usage and data organization.</p>
