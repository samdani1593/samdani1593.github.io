The protein-peptide complexes can be rescored using ZRANK2 and the flexible refinement of the large protein-peptide complexes can also be performed using FlexPepDock.

It allows users to interactively choose options for performing ligand optimization for large sets of ligands. POAP uses GNU parallel to perform the fast and efficient way for the completion of jobs by optimally utilising multiple CPU threads, thereby reducing the time effectively. It also quarantines the ligands causing error during preparation, enabling seamless operability.
